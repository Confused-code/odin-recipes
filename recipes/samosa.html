        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Dough prep</h4>
        <p>The dough or atta for samosa is made with maida (all purpose flour), ghee and salt. This is similar to making pastry for pies where the flour and ghee and mixed together till the mixture is crumbly and then water is adding little by little till the dough comes together.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Don't over knead or your samosas will be tough instead of crispy</li>
            <li>
                Its okay if you can see small pockets of ghee in your dough
            </li>
            <li>Its normal for the dough to have dimples or cracks. It need not be smooth</li>
            <li>The dough should be kneaded in a way that its stiff. That's what helps form the crispy crust. If your dough is too soft, you've added too much water and this will make it difficult to wrap samosas and the crust won't be crispy</li>
            <li>Rest the dough for 30-40 minutes for best results</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Samosa Filing prep</h4>
        <p>The filling or stuffing for samosas is easy to put together once you have all the ingredients. The potatoes are pre-boiled, peeled and mashed lightly before adding them to the cooked aromatics and spices.</p>
